# Monster

This is a simple project to demo my ability to optimize a simple problem.

## Why Feed the Monster
In this case I spend several days looking for the right data for a problem I've been thinking about for quite some time. I realized that for demo purposes it would be quicker to use mock data for a mock problem.

## Premise
You're a monster on a budget. You want to eat as many animals as possible, but there's an energy cost for hunting, catching, and eating each monster.

Given your energy budget, the optimizer will give you, the monster, a hunting list

Considering all the available animals, you don't have the time or the monster math chops to think through each combo. You're also worried that an optimization algorithm might be lazy and give you a 'better' result, but not the bets (ie local maximum).

This optimizer uses [simlated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) and a novel approach at temperature control.
